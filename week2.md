## Context: 
Rural residents of West Texas face perisstent challenges in accessing timely and affordable healthcare due to physican shortages, long travel distances, and inconsitent broadband connectivity. Telehealth has emerged as a viable solution but adoption is uneven, hindered by digital iteracy gaps, infrastructure issues, and provider workflow concerns.
