Project Pitch Memo: Expanding Telehealth Operations in Rural West Texas

# Problem:
Rurual communites across West Texas face perisstenet barriers in healthcare access, including geographic isolation, shortages of medical professionals, limitied broadband infrastructure and higher rates of chronic diseases compared to urban couterparts. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services over 60% of West Texas Counties are designated health professional shortage areas and patients often travel 100+ miles for basic healthcare which leads to delayed diagnoses, poor helath outcomes and finacnial burdens.
Telehealth has been in use since the 1950s and surged use during the COVID-19 pandemic. But infrastructure gaps still remain and limited digital literacy continues to hinder sustainable use in rural ares. 

# Stakeholders:
Rural communities
Patients
Univserity Health Programs
Clinicians and specialists
State and Federal Agencies like HRSA
Grant programs to fund Telehealth

# Scope:
In-Scope
A telehealth pilot involving multiple rural clinics in West Texas.
Secure telehalth communicatiosn
Electronic medial record integration
Providing necessary Telehealth equipment to rural clinics
Remote patient education materials
Out-of-scope:
Regional rollout beyond the pilot sites
Advanced specialy services
Broadband infrastructure upgrades

# Success Metrics
### Access: At least 10 successful telehealth sessions completed during pilot.
### Efficiency: Reduction in Patient Travel to clinic visits
### Satisfaction: Improved positive feeback from patients and providers. 
### Reach: Engagment across 3+ counties in Rural West Texas
### Compliance: No HIPAA violations or reported privacy breaches

# Minimal Viable Artifact (MVA)
Telehelath platform
Scheduling assistant
Compliance

# Iterative Design Approach
Development proceeds in 2 week cycles
Cycle 1: Deploy patient portral and provider dashboard; use secure video sessions
cycle 2: Introduce scheduling assistant: refien workflows based on provider/patient feedback
cycle 3: continue enforcing compliance; expand reporting dashboard

# Working with AI
Used ChatGPT prompt: Please create a memo for a comprehensive project pitch package for expanding telehlath operations in rural West Texas. I use the guidance as the template for this iteration.
# Submission notes
Supporting documents, formulas, and onboarding workflows will be documented in /docs/ withing the project repository.
I'm at a very Beginner level for Github, I have a guide open on how to write using Markdown, so please bear with my inexperience while I commit changes and update the project.
